 Edges - Attributes
####################

There are few edge attributes implemented in the `anemoi-graphs`
package:

*************
 Edge length
*************

The `edge length` is a scalar value representing the distance between
the source and target nodes. This attribute is calculated using the
Haversine formula, which is a method of calculating the distance between
two points on the Earth's surface given their latitude and longitude
coordinates.

.. code:: yaml

   edges:
     - source_name: ...
       target_name: ...
       edge_builders: ...
       attributes:
         edge_length:
            _target_: anemoi.graphs.edges.attributes.EdgeLength

****************
 Edge direction
****************

The `edge direction` is a 2D vector representing the direction of the
edge. This attribute is calculated from the difference between the
latitude and longitude coordinates of the source and target nodes.

.. code:: yaml

   edges:
     - source_name: ...
       target_name: ...
       edge_builders: ...
       attributes:
         edge_length:
            _target_: anemoi.graphs.edges.attributes.EdgeDirection

*********************
 Attribute from Node
*********************

Attributes can also be copied from nodes to edges. This is done using
the `AttributeFromNode` base class, with specialized versions for source
and target nodes.

From Source
===========

This attribute copies a specific property of the source node to the
edge. Example usage for copying the cutout mask from nodes to edges in
the encoder:

.. code:: yaml

   edges:
     # Encoder
   - source_name: data
     target_name: hidden
     edge_builders: ...
     attributes:
       cutout: # Assigned name to the edge attribute, can be different than node_attr_name
         _target_: anemoi.graphs.edges.attributes.AttributeFromSourceNode
         node_attr_name: cutout

From Target
===========

This attribute copies a specific property of the target node to the
edge. Example usage for copying the coutout mask from nodes to edges in
the decoder:

.. code:: yaml

   edges:
      # Decoder
    - source_name: hidden
      target_name: data
      edge_builders: ...
      attributes:
        cutout: # Assigned name to the edge attribute, can be different than node_attr_name
          _target_: anemoi.graphs.edges.attributes.AttributeFromTargetNode
          node_attr_name: cutout
