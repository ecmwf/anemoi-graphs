### Changed

- ci: small fixes and updates pre-commit, downsteam-ci (#49)
- Update CODEOWNERS (#61)
- ci: extened python versions to include 3.11 and 3.12 (#66)
- Update copyright notice (#67)

### Removed

- Remove `CutOutZarrDatasetNodes` class. (#68)
- Update CODEOWNERS
- Fix pre-commit regex
- ci: extened python versions to include 3.11 and 3.12
- Update copyright notice
- Fix `__version__` import in init
- The `edge_builder` field in the recipe is renamed to `edge_builders`. It now receives a list of edge builders. (#70)
- The `{source|target}_mask_attr_name` field is moved to inside the edge builder definition. (#70)

## [0.3.0 Anemoi-graphs, minor release](https://github.com/ecmwf/anemoi-graphs/compare/0.2.1...0.3.0) - 2024-09-03

### Added

- HEALPixNodes - nodebuilder based on Hierarchical Equal Area isoLatitude Pixelation of a sphere

- Inspection tools: interactive plots, and distribution plots of edge & node attributes.

- Graph description print in the console.

- CLI entry point: 'anemoi-graphs inspect ...'.

- added downstream-ci pipeline and cd-pypi reusable workflow

- Changelog release updater

- Create package documentation.


### Changed

- fix: added support for Python3.9.
- fix: bug in graph cleaning method
- fix: `anemoi-graphs create` CLI argument is casted to a Path.
- ci: fix missing binary dependency in ci-config.yaml
- fix: Updated `get_raw_values` method in `AreaWeights` to ensure compatibility with `scipy.spatial.SphericalVoronoi` by converting `latitudes` and `longitudes` to NumPy arrays before passing them to the `latlon_rad_to_cartesian` function. This resolves an issue where the function would fail if passed Torch Tensors directly.
- ci: Reusable workflows for push, PR, and releases
- ci: ignore docs for downstream ci
- ci: changed Changelog action to create PR
- ci: fixes and permissions on changelog updater
